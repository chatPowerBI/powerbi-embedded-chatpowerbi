# Introduction

This repository implements Power BI Embedding (apps own data) using NodeJS. It is based on the [Microsoft PowerBI-Developer-Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Developer-Samples) repository. However, we go a step further by demonstrating how to embed not only an entire report, but also a custom visual. In our case, the custom visual is (chatPowerBI)[https://chatpowerbi.ai], which allows users to interact with their report data using natural language through generative AI. It's like having the power of ChatGPT embedded directly within Power BI.
